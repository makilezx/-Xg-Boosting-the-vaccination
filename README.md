# (Xg)-Boosting-the-vaccination

## Baseline - study published in 2023.

A sample was comprised of 347 participants (42.1% male) from the general population in Serbia, aged between 19 and 54 years (M = 29.98, SD = 9.42). The data for this study were gathered online in April 2021, approx three months after the commencement of vaccination in Serbia. The logistic regression analysis was applied with vaccination status as criteria (coded as 0 = not vaccinated and not planning to apply for and 1 = applied for or already vaccinated) and the following variables as predictors: socio-demographic variables (gender, age, educational level, material status, number of household members), knowledge about coronavirus, general anxiety disorder, Big Five personality traits, and political orientation (left-right). The results revealed that certain factors were statistically significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. The model (ùúí2(13) = 45.15, p < .001) explained between 12% (Cox & Snell R2) and 16% (Nagelkerke R2) of criterion variance and correctly classified 63.4% of cases. Specifically, the age (Exp(B) = 1.06, p < .001), educational level (Exp(B) = 1.39, p = .003), and general anxiety disorder (Exp(B) = 1.43, p = .046) were found to be significant predictors, all in a positive direction. In other words, a higher vaccine acceptance rate is more probable among older participants, those with higher educational level, and those who have higher scores on the general anxiety disorder scale. It is noteworthy that other socio-demographic characteristics as well as personality traits, knowledge about coronavirus, and political orientation did not emerge as significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccination status. However, the non-significant role of personality traits may suggest that other factors may play a more influential role in vaccination decision-making.


## Aim

The primary objective was to explore whether machine learning binary classification models, relying on data from the study, could provide deeper insights into the factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Mentioned logistic regression analysis identified age, educational level, and general anxiety disorder as significant predictors. This leads us to a crucial question: can machine learning models complement these findings and offer additional perspectives? Essentially, by employing machine learning techniques, can we unveil patterns, interactions, and non-linearities that eluded the logistic regression analysis alone, thereby gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in the studied population?

While both the classical logistic regression analysis outlined in the abstract and the machine learning approach share the fundamental purpose of predicting a binary outcome (in this case, COVID-19 vaccine acceptance), they differ significantly in their methodologies, capabilities, and the insights they provide. Algorithms like decision trees, support vector machines, and ensemble methods (such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting) can handle more complex patterns. So, what do these patterns reveal?
